## Zadanie domowe Wady i zalety dokumentacji Confluence/Jira/Flare



### **Introducion (really short one)**
I’m in love-hate relationship with Jira and its partner Confluence. Both tools go together like peas and carrots. As you problably know already. I'm not very technical person yet. That's the reason why I'm enthusiastic about tools making my work clear, visible step by step and easy to share. And scared the same time. My opinion is a vision of absolute beginner.

### **Jira for teamwork**
As its manual says, Jira is project tracking and management system used by teams. It supports both traditional and agile project management. The workflow allows users to control the status of the project. The tool is very useful when you know precisely how it works. Atlassian University suggests to "think of Jira like a to-do list for your entire team. It helps everyone on your team track their work items and make sure they deliver on time". 


### pros:
•	Thanks to JIRA you can see every piece of work progress, who is expected to do something, who finished already and who just started.

•	Shows bigger picture and details.

•	Created to manage the teamwork. When you use Jira you automatically become more organised

•	You see the progress and what needs to be done. It’s a bit like watching a hourglass and seeing how much time you have left.
•	An easy connection with Confluence. 


### cons:
•	Jira is too complex and troubleshooting at first view.
•	In my opinion could be a bit more user friendly. Especially for brand new user.
