### **Introducion (really short one)**
I’m in love-hate relationship with Jira and its partner Confluence. Both tools go together like peas and carrots. As you problably know already. I'm not very technical person yet. That's the reason why I'm enthusiastic about tools making my work clear, visible step by step and easy to share. And scared the same time. My opinion is a vision of absolute beginner.

### **Jira for teamwork**
As its manual says, Jira is project tracking and management system used by teams. It supports both traditional and agile project management. The workflow allows users to control the status of the project. The tool is very useful when you know precisely how it works. Atlassian University suggests to "think of Jira like a to-do list for your entire team. It helps everyone on your team track their work items and make sure they deliver on time". 


### pros:
•	Thanks to JIRA you can see every piece of work progress, who is expected to do something, who finished already and who just started.

•	Shows bigger picture and details.

•	Created to manage the teamwork. When you use Jira you automatically become more organised

•	You see the progress and what needs to be done. It’s a bit like watching a hourglass and seeing how much time you have left.
•	An easy connection with Confluence. 

* free lessons for beginners you can get at "Atlassian University". Tou can watch it or download and read it.

### cons:
•	Jira is too complex and troubleshooting at first view.

•	In my opinion could be a bit more user friendly. Especially for brand new user.

•	My usual way of learning is to try, to make mistakes and to understand what went wrong and why. Just to wander around in circles. I prefer discover the tool on my own, not using guides or tutorials. Its not possible with Jira. My first experience with the tool was making the board invisible not only for me, but also for my co-students. I couldn't undo it myself, had to ask for help and pissed off the whole team.



### **Confluence**
### **sharing is caring**
Goes together with Jira. Enables sharing content across different people, being in different places. The content is visible to the people we choose. Possibility for users to have access to create the content together, the same time. We practised it creating the mobile as a team the same time.

### pros:
•	Easy connection with Jira. 

•	A lot of templates make the work easier but you can also choose your own way to do the things. 

•	The tool dedicated to create, edit and organize pages by teams using scrum method.

•	Value added is clarity and discipline of working process.

### cons:
•	The process to create pages and upload content is not that intuitive. 

•	It takes sometime for an user to get used to it. Maybe the solution is to use it as often as possible.

### **Flare**
### **any screen you want**


Different kettle of fish from Atlassian software. Content import tool. Flare offers the possibility to import of content for many types of files by using an drag and drop method to migrate the content.

I used Flare import quide just to start. Its form seems to be a bit old fashioned if you compare it to Confluence and Jira guides, but its easy to navigate

Content in MadCap Flare is organized differently than for example Microsoft Word. It is stored in topics and other files such as images and videos. It contains plenty of templates as Confluence does but used different way.

### pros:
•	There is a large selection of visual effects available. 

•	selection of templates

•	A lot of options to adapt the content to be printed or adapt to web media, tablet or mobile version but somebody has to show you how to use them. More than once.

### cons:

•	It seems impossible to learn Madcap Flare by yourself, so you are obliged to watch tutorials and guides. The more the better.

•	Flare seems complicated to me, so training and education is important. I believe that even after that I will need some assistance.

•	The software is overwhelming.
